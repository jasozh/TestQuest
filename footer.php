                    <p> [32] But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and
                        praising pain
                        was
                        born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of
                        the great
                        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
                        avoids
                        pleasure
                        itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
                        rationally

                        [33] On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
                        beguiled and
                        demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
                        foresee the
                        pain
                        and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
                        through
                        weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
                        are
